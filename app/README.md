# Branch Pattern

A good branch name should have 2 parts:

## 1 - Porpose

By "Porpose", we mean the "why" the branch was created. It can be:
- feat
- fix
- docs
- style
- refactor
- perf
- build

## 2 - Specification

It is the specification about what will be done in this branch. 
You can put whatever you want here, but it must be under 10 characters.
