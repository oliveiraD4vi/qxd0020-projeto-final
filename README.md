# :checkered_flag: GranCARS

GransCARS is an online car rental system for a fictitious rental company located in the city of Quixad√° - CE.

## :people_holding_hands: User roles

Logged in customer, not logged in customer and administrator.

## :spiral_calendar: Entities or system tables

User, Car and Reserve.

## :triangular_flag_on_post: Main features of the application

The customer does not need to be authenticated to view information about available cars, but will need to create an account to make a reservation. The customer will make a reservation and, after confirming the payment, will receive a proof of payment for picking up the vehicle. The customer will also be able to view his old transactions.

The administrator, in turn, will be able to see a list of each system entity (car, clients and administrator), as well as delete, edit and create new ones. In this way, we will have the possibility for the administrator to register and make a reservation for a customer in person, as well as register new administrators.
